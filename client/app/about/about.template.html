        <h3>I am a full stack web developer and I've created web applications working on both the front end and the back end.
            I've created applications using front end frameworks like AngularJS and Bootstrap. I've worked with server side
            frameworks like NodeJS and ExpressJS. I am comfortable using various databases like MongoDB and MySQL. I enjoy

        <h1>Favorite Project</h1>
        <h3>My favorite project was working with Vault RMS and their CEO Chris Memmott. Vault RMS helps firefighters track on
            the job injuries and the application I worked on with Chris helped digitize the many handwritten forms firefighters
            would have to fill out. Our application allowed users to log into the platform and begin filling out forms digitally.
            The forms will be prepopulated with user data from a master key. This helps expedite the process for the user
            so he/she does not have to fill out redundant user data (name, address, birthday, etc.). It was great working
            with a passionate client and working on a project that had real-world application.</h3>
