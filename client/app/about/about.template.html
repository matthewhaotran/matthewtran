        <h3>After studying chemistry in college at California State University, Los Angeles, I spent 5 years working as a scientific
            researcher at biotechnology companies in San Diego. While I am continually passionate about scientific innovation
            and progressve health care treatment, I could not resist the urge to pursue my passion in technology. I pursued
            a career change to web and software development through self teaching and attending a full time coding bootcamp
            at Origin Code Academy. I've developed several full stack web applications using a wide range of technoligies.
            I strive to continually master the tools I already hold while regulary adding new techniques, libraries, and
            frameworks. I am a lifelong learner and find the challenges of acquiring new skills exhilirating.</h3>

        <h1>Favorite Project</h1>
        <h3>My favorite project was working with Vault RMS and their CEO Chris Memmott. Vault RMS helps firefighters track on
            the job injuries and the application I worked on with Chris helped digitize the many handwritten forms firefighters
            would have to fill out. Our application allowed users to log into the platform and begin filling out forms digitally.
            The forms would be prepopulated with user data from a master key. This helps expedite the process for the user
            so he/she does not have to fill out redundant user data (name, address, birthday, etc.). It was great working
            with a passionate client and working on a project that had real-world application.</h3>
