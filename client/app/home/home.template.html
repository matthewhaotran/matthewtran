        <h3>No one should feel restricted to pursue one passion, and I emphatically encourage everyone to seek out different
            avenues towards whatever inspires themselves.</h3>

        <h3>After starting my career in scientific research and biotechnology, within the last year I transitioned to web and
            software technology and never looked back. I love having the ability to create from scratch using powerful software
            tools, addressing real-world problems with practical web applications, and working with like-minded innovative
            people in the technology community.</h3>

        <h3>I live an active lifestyle and enjoy the outdoors, rock climbing, live music, great microbreweries, and sports.</h3>
